# DengueSafe-App
Our DengueSafe app aims to help students of Nanyang Technological University by providing information about on campus reported dengue cases.

## Functionality
1. Allowing admin users (NTU Staffs, Fullerton or Jurong Hospital staffs) to report on campus dengue cases

2. Show the active cases and the cases reported today in the university, using a Hotspot Map of the campus implemented using Google Map API. The app is able to send an alert if any Hall of Residence has more than or equal to 16 active cases. Such areas are referred to as “Red Alert Areas”.

3. Retrieve real time data of dengue cases in Singapore and represent it using maps and line charts to be informative and useful for the students.
The app is able to send an alert when the number of cases in Singapore are shifting towards the university, and it detects that there might soon be an inflation of dengue cases on campus.
